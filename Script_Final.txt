Assalamualaikum,
Today I will prsent our idea Mini project for 
Data Structures and Algorithms-I from our Group.
Our mini project is about Covid-19 Vaccine regulation.

//Slide 2
Here you can see the environment used to create the project. We have 
used C and visual studio code.

//slide 3
Now I will discuss about the problem which Inspried to our project:
During this pandemic, ensuring that every citizen of the country gets 
the vaccine is a really important job. But maintaining the record of 
the citizens who got the vaccine and who did not is quite a difficult 
task. Although online registration is possible for many but not for 
everyone. By not for everyone, I mean people who don’t have access to 
Internet (remote area), people who don’t know have access to technology 
in General. Also, sometimes it can be difficult to complete the 
registration of mass people as the servers will be busy.


//slide 4
For this reason, we have come up with the idea of offline vaccine 
regulation system. It works most similarly like the online version 
but it works offline and faster.


//slide 5
This is the basic flow chart of our program

//slide 6
Here are some inputs and outputs of how out program will work. 
Not all features are shown.The ouput are show in like the 
flowchart order.
This is the menu


//Slide 7
This is vaccine add and registration windows

//slide 8
Here we can see all registered user

//slide 9
These are the test questions for taking vaccine.

//slide 10
Once they pass all question they will be able to select which vaccine they
want to take

//slide 11
The Vaccine name and date will be added to their information


//slide 12
This is an example of indiviual user search using nid. Here you will be able to see
vaccine name and age also.

//slie 13
The further plan for this app is to make the app cross platform with graphics ui so 
that user will have more friendly experience. And also connect govt database api 
for nid card verification
